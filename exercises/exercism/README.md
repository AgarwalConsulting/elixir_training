# To solve exercism exercises

- `cd` into the exercise directory

- Edit the file under the `lib/` directory

- Run the test cases using `mix test` from the same directory

## For eg: `log-level`

- `cd exercises/exercism/log-level`

- Edit `lib/log_level.ex` file and save

- Run the test cases from the same directory using mix:

```bash
elixir-training/exercises/exercism/log-level $ mix test
```
