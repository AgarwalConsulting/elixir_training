# Basic Challenges

0. [Log Level](https://github.com/AgarwalConsulting/Elixir_Training/tree/master/exercises/exercism/log-level)
  - For case/cond and atoms

1. Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

2. Write a function to find factorials for a given n

3. Write a function to generate 'n' numbers from fibonacci series

4. Prime Numbers

Loop through the numbers from 2 to 25 and print out which numbers are prime, and for those numbers which are not prime numbers, you should print them as a product of two factors
Remember that prime = no divisors other than 1 and itself
Don't worry about efficiency, but if you're interested, check out `:math.sqrt`

```
2 is prime
3 is prime
4 is product of 2 * 2
...
```

5. Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with and, the first terms will be:

```
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

6. Sum Square Difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

```
(1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2) = 385
```

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

```
(1+2+...+10)^2 = 55 ^ 2 = 3025
```

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
`3025 - 385 = 2640`.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

7. Input from user

Have the user enter a string, then loop through the string to generate a new string in which every character is duplicated, e.g., "hello" => "hheelllloo".

Test with "世界" as input.
